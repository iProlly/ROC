      <h2>About</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
        I feel like chemistry is a hard subject to understand thoroughly, especially for beginners and someone who self-study it. 
        It does not only contain tons of hard-to-understand concepts, theories, but also equally masochistic calculations.
        Without guidances, it is quite easy to get lost in the vastly endless realm of chemistry.
        I studied basic chemistry from teachers since I was 12. I start getting interested and ambitious about it back then.
        I wanted to dive much deeper into it when I was 15, but I feel so lost and I do not know where to start from.
        There was literally no one to guide me through, and the online resources were limited back then. 
        By the time I discovered the effective ways to master chemistry, I was already an undergrad...
        So, I decided to create this website to share my knowledge and resources that I found useful to study, covering every levels of chemistry.
        You will find some guides, textbook recommendations, exams past papers, and other useful resources here. 
        I am Thai so a lot of the content is based on Thailand's curriculum, but I believe it is still useful for everyone around the world.

      <h2>About Author</h2>
      <h3 style="text-indent: 2em;">Now who am I?</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
        So my full name is JATUPORNMONGKOL Sorawich, but people would call me Peter. I'm a fresh graduate so I'm currently in the early 20s.
        I graduated with B.Sc. in Chemistry with minor in Physics (Sound scary to some people) with 1st hons from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
        I think I am mainly focused on science so I would call myself a scientist. (but I also did a lot of things other than science, including this website)
        I do not have my 'best' or 'specialty' in chemistry because I already made myself a master of all topics, at least at undergrad level. 
        However, I'm currently interested in chemistry that use a heavy mathematical skill, such as instanton theory, 
        string theory, group theory, quantum field theory, and complex chemical system. (because this area of chemistry is rarely discovered by chemists due to heavy math)
        I currently work as a freelancer who keeps studying quantum field theory alone in the corner of the room, preparing for the next steps that I have planned.
        I also do some side projects, including this website, to keep myself more skilled general specialist enough to jump back into industry again.

        Now if you are interested in knowing more about me, you can find me on this email so we can discuss things together: jp.sorawich@gmail.com.
        If you are interested in my academic background, you can check my shortened resume <a href="pdf/Resume.pdf" download>here</a>. Thank you for visiting this website!
