        <h2>High School Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
          High school chemistry is where you begin to see the full scope of the subject. You will study about the principles,
          and reasons behind the changes. You will be able to explain a lot of chemical situations with accuracy. 
          You will have to perform the calculation, which will give you the answer in quantitative ways. 
          After this point, you will be able to perform some basic experiments with good practice.

        <h2>Laboratory Skills</h2>
        <p>
          Laboratory skills should be practiced along with the theory. In high school level, laboratory is usually done to enhance your understanding
          , which is quite different from undergraduate level.
          Here are some basic laboratory works you should be able to perform at high school level. 
          You do not need to do all of them, but here is recommended list:
        </p>
        <h4>Grade 10 (M.4) semester 1</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lab Safety and Glassware Skills (Important!)</strong>: you must know how to handle each glasswares, and how to do in laboratory.</li>
          <li><strong>Separation of Mixture (Important!)</strong>: filtration, evaporation, distillation.</li>
          <li><strong>Flame tests</strong>: you should know about atomic spectra and color of the flame.</li>
          <li><strong>Precipitation</strong>: you must know which ionic compounds are soluble or insoluble in water.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Grade 10 (M.4) semester 2</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Solution preparation (Important!)</strong>: you must be able to properly prepare and to dilute solution. KMnO<sub>4</sub> is a good choice to try.</li>
          <li><strong>Stoichiometry</strong>: you should perform some reaction to find reaction yield. (for example, CaCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) â†’ CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) â†“ + 2NaCl(aq)).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Grade 11 (M.5) semester 1</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Gas Laws</strong>: you should understand relationship between pressure, volume, temperature using gas laws.</li>
          <li><strong>Gas Stoichiometry</strong>: you should perform some reaction to find reaction yield. (for example, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH(aq) + NaHCO<sub>3</sub>(aq) â†’ CH<sub>3</sub>COONa(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)).</li>
          <li><strong>Reaction Rate</strong>: you should understand the factors affecting reaction rate. You may try iodine clock reaction or magnesium in hydrochloric acid.</li>
          <li><strong>Chemical Equilibrium</strong>: you should try Le ChÃ¢telierâ€™s principle. One example is equlibrium of [Fe(SCN)]<sup>2+</sup>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Grade 11 (M.5) semester 2</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Acid-bases Titration (Important!)</strong>: you must be able to perform titration between strong acid and strong base.</li>
          <li><strong>Electrochemistry</strong>: you should try building galvanic cell and measuring its voltage. One example is Daniel's cell. (Zn-Cu)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Grade 12 (M.6) semester 1</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Esterification</strong>: you should try performing esterification. One example is banana oil. (which is results from isoamyl alcohol + acetic acid)</li>
          <li><strong>Soap Preparation</strong>: you should try performing saponification, so that you can make soap.</li>
          <li><strong>Qualitative Test for Functional Group</strong>: you should be able to tell what kind of organic compound this is. For example, you may use 2,4-DNP to test for carbonyl group.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Grade 12 (M.6) semester 2</h4>
        <ul><li>At this level, you can use your knowledge to design your experiments by yourself.</li></ul>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
          <p>
            Stay tuned! I will add some material for each topic soon.

        <h2>What's next?</h2>
          <p>
            After you finish high school curriculum, there are literally many things you can do. 
            For example:
          <ul>
            <li>You may try doing competition like POSN to enhance your understanding about chemistry.</li>
            <li>You may start doing your own mini project, such as using compounds to make some products, 
            or doing some quantitative analysis of some samples, says vitamin C in orange juice.</li>
            <li>You may just practice yourself for university entrance exam if you need one.</li>
            <li>If you are really interested in chemistry, you may also start reading some advanced books to prepare yourself for undergraduate level.</li>
          </ul>
          Knowledge is not limited to what you learn in school, so you may explore more by yourself even if you are just high schooler.
