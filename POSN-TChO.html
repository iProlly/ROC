          <h2>POSN and TChO</h2>
          <p>POSN is "The Promotion of Academic Olympiad and Development of Science Education Foundation", so it is one kind of foundation that
            promote students to pursue academic olympiad, especially in science subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics. 
            (Anyway, I am focusing on chemistry part here). So basically, if you can get through the selection process of chemistry POSN, 
            you will be qualified to compete in TChO (Thailand Chemistry Olympiad), and IChO (International Chemistry Olympiad) afterward. 
            The first TChO was held in 2005, and the competition is mainly for high school students.
            <h3>Some key features of POSN (Chemistry)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Grade Limit</strong>: participants must be in between G9 and G11 (so M.3 to M.5).</li>
              <li><strong>Exams Format</strong>: theoretical, practical, and multiple-choice sections.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>POSN Selection Process</h2>
          <p>The details of selection process can be found <a href="https://www.posn.or.th/projects/academic-olympiad/cho/about/">here</a>. (TH language)
            The selection process is quite complex, so let's break it down clearly.
            There are roughly 14 centres (varied by subjects) across Thailand that host the POSN exams. In each centre, there will be 3 rounds of exams.
            After those 3 rounds, the top 6 students from each centre (18 for Bangkok centre because there are 3 sub-centres in Bangkok) will be selected to join the TChO.
            Here are the details of each round (KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DETAILS BELOW VARY DEPENDING ON EACH CENTERS):

        <p>
            After you pass preliminary round, you will be invited to attend a training camp in round 1 and round 2 before taking exam of that round,
            and you must attend the camp to be eligible for the exam. You will learn a lot of new things in the camp, 
            and the exam will be based on what you learned.
            The camp usually lasts for 2-3 weeks NON-STOP, so better prepare yourself beforehand.
          </p>

          <p>
        Here comes one of the most popular question "What is the cut-off marks?". It is really hard to say with confidence so 
        basically I would say "I don't know".
        The cut-off marks are different every year, depending on the difficulty of the exam and the performance of participants.
        However, from my experience: (I participated in Bangkok centre, and currently coaching students for TChO)
        <ul>
          <li>Preliminary Round: if you can do >50 out of 75, you should be safe.</li>
          <li>Round 1: > 60% of full mark is quite safe.</li>
          <li>Round 2: > 70% of full mark is quite safe, but better aim for the highest you can do.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>TChO</h2>
          <p>After you pass all 3 rounds of POSN, you will be qualified to join TChO (Thailand Chemistry Olympiad). 
            The syllabus of TChO is everything you learned in every round of POSN, plus some special topics (depending on the year). 
            The compeition is much more intense than POSN since you have to compete with the representatives from all over Thailand.
            TChO usually takes place around May to June, and the exam format is quite similar to POSN, (theoretical, practical) but somewhat different.
            <h3>Exam format</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Length of competition</strong>: 5 days</li>
              <li><strong>Exams Format</strong>: 5 hours of theoretical exam + 3 hour of practical exam</li>
              <li><strong>Mark distribution</strong>: 60% theoretical exam + 40% practical exam</li>
              <li><strong>Participants</strong>: more than 100 people</li>
              <li><strong>Award distribution</strong>: ~10 gold medals, ~20 silver medals, ~30 bronze medals</li>
            </ul>
            If you perform exceptionally well in TChO (At least silver medal), you will be
            invited to join IPST chemistry training camp, where you will be trained to compete in IChO (International Chemistry Olympiad) afterward.
            This camp is SUPER intense.
